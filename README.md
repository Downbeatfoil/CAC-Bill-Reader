Legify

Bridging the gap between citizens and Congress with three core features:

Bill Summarizer: Drop a bill text, file, or URL link, and get a concise, easy-to-understand summary.
New Bill Hub: Track recent congressional actions. Summaries and news links for the latest bills.
Find Representative: Enter an address to find your congressional rep. Includes district maps and detailed profiles.
Inspiration
Legify was born out of a real gap in civic understanding. During a school debate, it became clear that many people—students and adults alike—were out of the loop on key policies and representatives. Legify makes government info simple, so everyone can be part of the conversation.

Technical Challenges

Summarization Model: Built a custom Large Language Model (LLM) to handle legislative content. Getting accurate summaries from multiple formats (text, file, URL) was a steep learning curve.
API Integration: Pulled rep data from the Congressional Database API. Managing real-time data flow and learning API protocols took time.
UI/UX: We wanted a clean, modern design that works for everyone. That meant diving deep into CSS, JavaScript, and figuring out how to keep it functional and sleek.
